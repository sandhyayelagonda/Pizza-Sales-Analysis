### Data Cleaning and Visualizations 

We have to Clean the data Before making a Visualization. For cleaning data, we use Power Query. The Core Purpose of Power Query is to transform data. This means modifying the layout, removing errors, and generally making the data more usable for analysis
In this process, we remove the unwanted data and add new columns to make necessary changes for making data usable for Visualizations
As per the requirement After exploring and cleaning data we will make a dashboard.
